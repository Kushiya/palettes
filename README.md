# Color Palettes Collection

### How to contribute to this repo

1. Fork this repo

2. Create a new markdown file in `/palettes` following this structure:

```
---
id: QDzzE2bs4
colors:
  - 00ff99
  - 00ff00
  - 0099ff
  - cccccc
liked: 0
---
```

`id:` should be a random string, its length is 9, you can generate one here: https://www.random.org/strings/, just make sure it's unique because it's the unique ID of the palette.

`colors:` find 4 colors which you believe that they can make a nice palette.

`liked:` should be 0 by default, people can send likes to their favorite palettes later.

Create the file name following this structure: map-colors-list-**00ff99**-**00ff00**-**0099ff**-**cccccc**-liked-0-id-**qdzze2bs4**.md

They are colors and unique ID all in lowercase.

3. Submit the PR, that's it.
